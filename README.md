# LennardGame
A game I made for a friend as a birthday gift. I made this game in 2018
You basically have to defend your house from weird Monsters with your 2 weapons.
The monsters drop "Schoppe" (which is apple-cider) and you have to collect them for points. You die, when your house is destroyed.
There also is an online highscore-list.
